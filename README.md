This repository mostly deals with my personal projects, stuff I've been involved with since my high school days, for fun (or for school nedds) :)  
Please note that the list is not complete, back then I didn't use to push *everything* I was doing on github, so I'm still trying to collect my old code and archive it here.

Also have a look at my ["Academic" repository](https://github.com/nicolasbenatti) which <div style="font-family: "Fira Sans";">contains</div> my university projects and has a richer Bio 😉
